## Install

1. Install Node.js.

      If you donâ€™t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

      If you want to check if Node.js has been installed successfully, open terminal and type ```node -v```.

      If everything is ok, you should see something like ```v20.13.1```

2. Install dependencies.
   ```
   npm install

   cd backend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Run the app.
   ```
   npm start
   ```

      You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
